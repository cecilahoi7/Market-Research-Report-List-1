<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deionized Water System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-bed Deionized Water System</li><li>Mixed-bed Deionized Water System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deionized water system market consists primarily of two types: two-bed deionized water systems and mixed-bed deionized water systems. Two-bed systems utilize separate cation and anion exchange columns, providing effective deionization but requiring periodic maintenance to recharge each bed. In contrast, mixed-bed systems combine both cation and anion resins in a single vessel, resulting in higher purity water due to the simultaneous removal of charged impurities. Mixed-bed systems often require less frequent maintenance but can be more complex in operation.</p></p>
